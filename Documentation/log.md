  - Think about a game, pulling ideas from games like Space engineers (thematically and graphical dream) , Aurora 4x (for the depth of gameplay), From the depths (for the advanced physics simulations and freedoms) 
    - Very little from Aurora, maybe also look into how we can make orbits fun
      - Orbital maneuvers? Like Kerbal Space Program?
  - Aircraft physics
  - In depth weapons systems
  - In depth propulsion systems 
    - Fusion torches require power, resources, cooling
    - Possibly implement something like the Elite Frame Shift Drive
      - Exclude witchspace as it gives too many freedoms and would make the project too large
      - Include *supercruise* as it enables travel at speed but still leaves the player vulnerable to encounters and such
        - *Supercruise interceptor?, AI Pulling players out of supercruise? Players pulling players out of supercruise?*   
  - Player is free to move like FtD and SE
    - Player does things to kickstart the major processes like SE
    - Maybe make production of things more factorio-like than SE like
    - **TODO**
      - Figure out how to do air sim (Airgear?)
      - Figure out how to do planet orbits *efficiently*
      - Decouple the camera from being a player so we can have TV Screens unlike SE
