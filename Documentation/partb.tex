# Choice of UI 
? Can this be done for a major part of the UI or *all* of the UI
# EBNF and Railroad diagrams
? 
# Unit test
# Error checking
# Desk Check
- evidence of use of breakpoints, traces, single line stepping
? How should we provide evidence of usage of breakpoints (dated screenshot? and if so how many?)
# Readability of code
- annotate 
? provide evidence
# Discussion of syntax errors, runtime errors, logic errors
? what they are or the common ones we experienced





B
# Testing and Evaluation
## Efficiency and Elegancy of code
- Give example
## Final UI design 
- Screen shot (literal)
# Maintenance
## Desc. suitable CASE tools to monitor changes and VCS
## Explain how you cater to changing user reqs
# Final Project
## Working demonstration
## Documentation
- User doc
? *Just* movement and manual things or...?
- Install docs
? can the install docs just say "extract and run" with screenshots?
## Project report
- Outline what I have learnt from the project dev.
- Future directions of the software
- Comparison with original specification
- **BIBLIOGRAPHY**
